# Lifeline Portfolio
## Vagabond
I am creating this Portfolio test website to showcase the skills i am currently learning and perfecting. 
The website is based off a tutorial from https://github.com/Maclinz/JS_CSS_PortfolioProject 

I have only just begun to learn the fundamentals, learn the code and the commands for HTML5, CSS and JS.
Hopefully when i am finished with this and i am more comfortable with the code, i can start to create more and then go to people with ambitions of creating the websites for them. 

(The main 2 pages are completed, and i currently working on the rest when i find the time.)
